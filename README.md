Looking for the Following Errors in BUGBENCH: Heap Overflow, Use after Free, Free not allowed, double free

1. BC - Compiled and Working. Throws errors which are detected by Sampler. We took the Stack Overflow out before compiling. See the TAR Ball in this repository.
2. Squid - Compiled. Not sure it's working correctly with Sampler. Giving up on this one for now.
3. CVS - Not sure if it's worth installing the versioning control software on the server.
