  'sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev'
3. Install PHP
  './configure --with-xmlrpc'
  modify Makefile in root PHP directory near line 72. Add "-rdynamic /home/sam/Sampler/source/libsampler.so -fno-omit-frame-pointer" to the "$CFLAGS_CLEAN" variable.
  'make' <- takes 5-10 minutes
  'sudo make install'
4. Verify Sampler Operation
  'php -v'
  Look for sampler's output along with PHP version info.
5. Run Heap Overflow Bug
  'php ./ho1.php'
  The script takes a few minutes to run. You should see a segmentation fault. The script is located in the root of the PHP directory.
