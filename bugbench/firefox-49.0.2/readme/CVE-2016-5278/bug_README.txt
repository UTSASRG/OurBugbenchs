Heap-based buffer overflow in the nsBMPEncoder::AddImageFrame function 
in Mozilla Firefox before 49.0 and Firefox ESR 45.x before 45.4 allows 
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted image data 
that is mishandled during the encoding of an image frame to an image.

Mozilla Firefox is prone to the following multiple security vulnerabilities: 

1. Multiple heap based buffer-overflow vulnerabilities. 
2. Multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities. 
3. A security vulnerability. 
4. Multiple unspecified memory-corruption vulnerabilities. 

Successful exploits may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in 
the context of the user running the affected application, bypass 
security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions by conducting a 
man-in-the-middle attack or result in denial-of-service conditions. 

These issues are fixed in: 

Firefox 49 
Firefox ESR 45.4
