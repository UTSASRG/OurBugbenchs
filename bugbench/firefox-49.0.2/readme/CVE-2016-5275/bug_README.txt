Buffer overflow in the 
mozilla::gfx::FilterSupport::ComputeSourceNeededRegions function in 
Mozilla Firefox before 49.0 allows remote attackers 
to execute arbitrary code by leveraging improper interaction between 
empty filters and CANVAS element rendering.

Mozilla Firefox is prone to the following multiple security vulnerabilities: 

1. Multiple heap based buffer-overflow vulnerabilities. 
2. Multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities. 
3. A security vulnerability. 
4. Multiple unspecified memory-corruption vulnerabilities. 

Successful exploits may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in 
the context of the user running the affected application, bypass 
security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions by conducting a 
man-in-the-middle attack or result in denial-of-service conditions. 

These issues are fixed in: 

Firefox 49 
Firefox ESR 45.4
