Heap-based buffer overflow in the 
nsCaseTransformTextRunFactory::TransformString function in 
Mozilla Firefox before 49.0 and Firefox ESR 45.x before 45.4 allows 
remote attackers to cause a denial of service 
(boolean out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via Unicode characters that are mishandled during text conversion.

Mozilla Firefox is prone to the following multiple security vulnerabilities: 

1. Multiple heap based buffer-overflow vulnerabilities. 
2. Multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities. 
3. A security vulnerability. 
4. Multiple unspecified memory-corruption vulnerabilities. 

Successful exploits may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in 
the context of the user running the affected application, bypass 
security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions by conducting a 
man-in-the-middle attack or result in denial-of-service conditions. 

These issues are fixed in: 

Firefox 49 
Firefox ESR 45.4
