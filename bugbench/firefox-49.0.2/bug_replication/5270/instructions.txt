The problem here arises when there's a character (like ß or ᾁ) that expands to multiple characters during uppercasing, and 
then we encounter a potential Irish grammatical prefix whose position (in the output string) we mark for possible further 
processing. This position will not be correct for the input string due to the earlier character expansion, leading to the 
out-of-bounds write if we then try to mark the input hyphen as a deleted character. The simple fix is to record both 
source and destination offsets, rather than using a single position as if it were valid for both.

STEPS TO REPLICATE:
(1) Install firefox 49.0.2 (instructions in src folder)
