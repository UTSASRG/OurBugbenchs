Steps to replicate this bug:
(1) Download tcpdump version 4.8.1 from https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump/releases/tag/tcpdump-4.8.1
(2)Download libpcap with git clone https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap.git
(3)Run ./configure --prefix=/BUILD_DIR/ in the libpcap directory
(4)Run make && make install
(5)Repeat steps 3 and 4 for tcpdump-4.8.1 with a new buid dir

Buffer overflow in ATM parser in print-atm.c:sig_print() was found that may 
cause a segmentation fault. This issue can be be exploited either locally by 
making the target system to decode crafted .pcap file using tcpdump, 
or remotely by sending crafted packets to the network segment where the target 
system is running tcpdump decoding the live packet capture.
