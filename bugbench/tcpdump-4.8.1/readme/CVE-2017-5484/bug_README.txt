The ATM parser in tcpdump before 4.9.0 has a buffer overflow in print-atm.c:sig_print().

tcpdump is prone to multiple buffer-overflow vulnerabilities because it fails to
adequately bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it to an 
insufficiently sized memory buffer. 

An attacker can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code within the 
context of the application. Failed exploit attempts will likely cause a 
denial-of-service condition. 

Versions prior to tcpdump 4.9.0 are vulnerable.
