Double free vulnerability in the iscsi_rx_handler function (usr/iscsi/iscsid.c)
in the tgt daemon (tgtd) in Linux SCSI target framework (tgt) before 1.0.14, 
aka scsi-target-utils, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service 
(memory corruption and crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown 
vectors related to a buffer overflow during iscsi login. NOTE: some of these 
details are obtained from third party information.
