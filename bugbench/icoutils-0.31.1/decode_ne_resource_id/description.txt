Description:

A buffer overflow was observed in "decode_ne_resource_id" function in "restable.c" source file. 
This is happening because "len" parameter for memcpy operation is not checked for size and thus becomes negative integer in the process, 
resulting in failed memcpy operation. This issue can be triggered by processing a corrupted exe file and will result in wrestool crash.
