Description:

A buffer overflow was observed in "decode_ne_resource_id" function in "restable.c" source file. This is happening because "len" parameter
for memcpy operation is not checked for size and thus becomes negative integer in the process, resulting in failed memcpy operation. This
issue can be triggered by processing a corrupted exe file and will result in wrestool crash.
