Here are the commands I ran on utsasrg2 to replicate the bug as closely as I could to 
the sample output. The sample data with valgrind output is in the input folder for comparison.

base64 -d data.PoC > PoC.ico
valgrind /home/riley/OurBugbenchs/bugbench/icoutils-0.31.1/src/icotool/icotool -l PoC.ico
