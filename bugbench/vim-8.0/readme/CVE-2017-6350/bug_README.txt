Vim is prone to an local integer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to adequately bounds-check 
user-supplied data before copying it into an insufficiently sized buffer. 

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected application. 
Failed exploit attempts will likely cause a denial-of-service condition.

An integer overflow at an unserialize_uep memory allocation site would occur for vim before patch 8.0.0378, 
if it does not properly validate values for tree length when reading a corrupted undo file, which may lead to 
resultant buffer overflows.
