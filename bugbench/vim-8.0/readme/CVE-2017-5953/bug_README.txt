Vim is prone to an local integer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to adequately bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it
into an insufficiently sized buffer. 

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will likely
cause a denial-of-service condition.

[vim before patch 8.0.0322 does not properly validate values for tree length when handling a spell file, 
which may result in an integer overflow at a memory allocation site and a resultant buffer overflow.]
