ngorca

   Password recovery tool for Oracle databes versions 7-11g Rel.2.

   ngorca is a multicore supported password recovery tool using exhaustive key
   search. Oracle databases encrypt passwords with a simple DES encryption
   algorithm, as described by Joshua Wright and Carlos Sid:
   'An Assessment of the Oracle Password Hashing Algorithm'.
   Due to the weak hashing algorithm and the constantly improvement hardware,
   performance, passwords can be found in minutes, depending on the length.

   ngorca supports muliple CPU cores by using threads. The number of threads can
   be set with the 't' option. For optimal results it is recommended to use the
   number of CPUs that are present in the machine.

   On a Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU ngorca calculates 1.6 million 6 byte
   passwords from an alphanumeric charset per second. This means you need
   23 minutes to find the correct password in the worst case.

Compilation:

   To compile ngorca just type './configure' followed by 'make' in the root
   directory of this package. The binary file could be found in the ngorca/src/bin
   directory where you can use it or use 'make install' to install ngorca.


Usage:

-f hashlist
   To use ngorca a list of username and hash is required, which has the format
   username:hash. The hash values are calculated one after another.
   example of hash file entry with old DES hash and SHA1 hash:
   NETGARAGE:5D7F5FD88AE4C07F:EAC3EAC57FF0635AB298EB40CBDA1BB45DFC1B7F20464AA591C1613A2CB8
   <username>:<16 byte DES hash>:<40 byte SHA1 hash + 20 byte salt>
   In oracle versions 7-10g there is only the DES hash.

-l password length
   Length of the password. If this option is not set the passwords from a length
   of 5-8 bytes are calculated.

-c charset
   The charset of the password. 1 for numeric, 2 for alpha, 3 for alpha numeric
   and 4 for alpha numeric with special characters. The default is 3.

-o logfile
   A logfile could be specified. It contains the passwords which are found and
   some info messages. The default logfile name is ngorca.log placed in the
   directory the binary runs.

-v verbose level
   Loglevel for the logfile and standard output 1 - 4 with 4 as the highest level
   which contains percent printouts. The default is 1.

-t thread number
   The number of threads which should be used. It is recommended to take the
   number of cpu's which you want to involve in the calculation for the best
   result. The default is 1.

example: ngorca -f hashlist -l6 -c3 -t2 -v4
